# JSON-Mini-Project
## Springboard Mini-Project - importing and manipulating JSON files

JSON example, with file
- demonstrates reading in a json file as a string and as a table
- uses small sample file containing data about projects funded by the World Bank
- data source: http://jsonstudio.com/resources/

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above:

- Find the 10 countries with most projects
- Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
- In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
